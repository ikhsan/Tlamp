## Rhythm based game for learning Sumatran percussion 'Talempong'

> We lack regeneration. Almost nobody wants to play this kind of music anymore. If this condition stagnates then **Gondang Opung** would likely to disappear from our **Gema** village in two years time.

If learning and playing music is fun then why some traditional music is on the verge of extinction? Although [**Talempong**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talempong) spreads across Sumatra and Indonesia, but in certain areas nobody wants to play it anymore. 

**Tlamp!** attempts to make the current situation better. But why games? Why software? I think software has a great chance to preserve musical traditions;

- serves as a form of documentation
- engaging people by its interactivity
- ubiquitous

So let's experiment with **Tlamp!**, a tool to engage audience to traditional music. [This video](http://youtu.be/VEmX-1_DQPA) is a good sample of what Talempong music sounds like.

##Technologies
It was built using Apple's `SpriteKit`. Tested only in Mac OS X 10.9 and Xcode 5.1. It uses [`IXNXBOXDrumPad`](https://github.com/ixnixnixn/IXNXBOXDrumpad) for Xbox's drumpad integration.
